# Problem Statement

As fantasy sports get more popular and more people get attracted to them, some issues have arisen
First of all, the transaction is not transparent and there is the possibility that it could be misappropriated
For a short period of time, it is possible for the users to not receive the price pool for a number of reasons.

## Proposing solution

Our decentralized fantasy sports app is designed to leverage the capabilities of both Ethereum and Polygon blockchains to create a seamless and secure user experience. Ethereum is a popular blockchain known for its robustness and security, while Polygon is a layer-2 scaling solution built on top of Ethereum, offering faster and cheaper transactions.

Our project is built on Ethereum and leverages its smart contract functionality to enable decentralized governance and secure player transactions. Ethereum's smart contracts allow for trustless interactions between users, ensuring transparency and fairness in the fantasy sports app.

To enhance the user experience and address scalability concerns, we have integrated Polygon as a layer-2 solution. Polygon allows for faster transaction times and lower fees compared to the Ethereum mainnet, making it more feasible for daily fantasy sports contests and quick transactions.

By utilizing Ethereum and Polygon in combination, our fantasy sports app benefits from Ethereum's security and decentralization, while leveraging Polygon's scalability and cost-efficiency. This dual-chain approach provides users with a seamless experience, enabling them to participate in fantasy sports contests with lower transaction fees and faster transaction times, while also ensuring the integrity and transparency of the game through Ethereum's smart contract functionality.

In summary, our decentralized fantasy sports app is designed to fit into the Ethereum + Polygon track by utilizing the strengths of both blockchains to create a secure, scalable, and user-friendly experience for fantasy sports enthusiasts.
